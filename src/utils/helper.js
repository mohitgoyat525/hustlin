We are organizing giveaways and events to spread the word around what will be one of the most exciting NFT projects so far. We also aim to reward those driving early engagement for the project in the form of white-list and pre-sale access to the official Hustlin’ Hardo drop. Join us on our Discord channel to see what we are all about!",

For example, one week after the minting event is sold out, we will raffle a Rolex GMT “Batman” among the lucky holders of Hustlin' Hardos wearing that specific watch - so be on the lookout for characters who hold items you would like to own. Each month, we will announce another similar raffle, where Hustlin’ Hardos will get the chance to win items worn by their favorite NFTs",

Imagine being able to bet on your Hustlin’ Hardo in a virtual foot race against your friend’s hardos. Since those events are free to enter, you can’t lose anything - but you can win BIG!",
